Giddy 3: Reasonably Special Wii Edition

This is the source to the Wii version of Giddy 3: RSE

Don't judge the code too harshly, it was mostly written while half asleep on
the train to work.

Enjoy :)


Note: You need to copy all the "hats" and "onion\*" folders from the normal
version of Giddy 3 to your Wii SD card, and swap the "hats/\*.wav" files
for the raw versions from this repository.

Messy, I know, but there you go.
